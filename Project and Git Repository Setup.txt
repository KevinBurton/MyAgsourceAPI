Egit/Project setup

In Git Repositories:
Clone remote repository.

You'll need the URI.  URI for MyAgsource for example:
ssh://kmarshall@feweb.verona.crinet/var/local/repos/MyAgsource.git

New > Project from Existing directory
Select the new clone in your local git folder
For example: C:\Users\kmarshall\git\MyAgsource\.git

Once project is loaded into PHP Explorer,
  right click on topmost project folder.
Choose Automatic Upload and enable it.

Then point it to Local Connection and the htdocs folder
  of your localhost.
  
For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs\app

Finally, get a working copy of index.php from a colleague or make
  one.  index.php should not be tracked and SHOULD be ignored as
  each machine in turn will need index.php to track the specific
  directory tree locally.  index.php should have its environment
  variable set to 'development' for programmers' machines,
  'testing' for the test server and 'production' for the live
  server.

The folder name for the local connection should be the same as
  other programmers' on the same project so urls on each machine
  are identical for troubleshooting purposes.
  
When everything is working, saving a file locally will
  automatically upload to the localhost for easy debugging.
  If it works correctly, Commit and Push to upload the change to
  the test server repository which in turn uploads to the test
  server host via a hook.  It will also allow other programmers
  to pull and retrieve your changes.

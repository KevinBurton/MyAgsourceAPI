In January AgSource launched KetoMonitor. KetoMonitor allows a dairy farmer to monitor the prevalence of sub clinical and clinical ketosis in fresh cows. MyAgSource users can receive KetoMonitor results as part of your MyAgSource subscription at no additional charge. Not all DHI milk laboratories can provide the data needed for KetoMonitor, check with your association manager to make sure AgSource is receiving the necessary milk sample data.

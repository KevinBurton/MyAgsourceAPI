With the rapid adoption of sexed semen, genomic testing and breeding to beef,  a herd has more means to speed up genetic improvement and profitability. To make sure you take full advantage, the Genetic Summary Report takes an in-depth look at the genetic composition of your herd, measuring the degree of inbreeding and making direct comparisons of your herd's genetic values to similar AgSource herds and the national dairy herd. It lists the top twelve sires in your herd based on performance of milking daughters. Click on SUMMARY REPORTS then Genetic Summary to review your herd's information.

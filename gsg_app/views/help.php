	<h2>A Message for our users who have found an error</h2>
		<p>We are doing our best to address every issue in a timely manner.
		However, we are undoubtly going to miss at least one thing as that
		is the nature of the programming business.</p>
		<p>This is where you, our users, come in. Every new program needs 
		feedback from its users.  Users always try things in ways the designers
		and programmers couldn't possibly have predicted. This is why engaged users
		are an essential and greatly appreciated part of every project's
		community.  Be sure to make use of uservoice linked above so we and
		the rest of the MyAgsource community hears from you.</p>
		<p>Thank you for helping us make MyAgsource.com fulfill your
		needs and the needs of our cooperative as a whole.</p>
	<h2>Known Issues</h2>

			<li>Google Chrome
				<p><label>Version 32</label> Chrome 32 contains a bug that affects our
					scatter plot graphs. Google pushed the fix up to Chrome 33.  If you're
					still using Chrome 32, please update to 33 or higher.

	<h2>Recommended Browser</h2>
		<p>While we are constantly addressing cross-browser compatibility
			issues and recognize our members have preferred browsers across the
			spectrum, we cannot promise 100% compatibility at all times with all
			browsers. As such, we can only inform you of compatibility issues as
			they arise and if/when they'll be addressed.</p>
		<p> We encourage you to use your favorite browser as you normally would
			and please inform us of any issues you encounter with the website 
			either via the uservoice or email links provided above.</p>
		<p> In the meantime, if you would like to view the website as it
			is intended to look for comparison, the browsers most compatibile
			with the site as of 03/03/2014 are:
			<ul><li><strong>Firefox</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Chrome 33 and above</strong></li></ul></p>
		<p> We will never require you to change browsers if it is within
			our power to fix an issue. However, some things are beyond our
			control and those things will be listed above in our Known Issues
			section. The browser(s) with the least known issues will be recommended
			here.</p>
		<p> Thanks for your understanding.</p>

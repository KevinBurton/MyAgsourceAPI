	<li><strong>A Message for our Beta Testers</strong><br /><br />
		We are doing our best to address every issue in a timely manner.  However, we are undoubtly going to miss at least
		one thing as that is the nature of the programming business.  This is where you come in.  Every new program needs
		a group of potential users to try things in ways the designers couldn't possibly have predicted and give feedback.
		This is why beta-testers are an essential and greatly appreciated part of every project's community. 
		Thank you for helping us make www.myagsource.com fulfill your needs and the needs of our cooperative as a whole.

			<li>Google Chrome
				<ul>
					<li>Version 32<br />
					 	Chrome 32 contains a bug that affects our scatter plot graphs.
						Google is aware of the issue and has a fix in the pipeline that should be released with Chrome 34.
						Expected release date of Chrome 34 is early 2nd quarter.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Explorer
				<ul>
					<li>Version 7 and lower<br />
						IE 7 and lower are incompatible with a code package essential to the site's ability to display cows
						when clicking on their identification links.  If you wish to be able to use this feature on a windows
						machine running Windows XP, consider using a different browser when visiting www.myagsource.com.

	<li><strong>Recommended Browser</strong>
		<div>
			While we are constantly addressing cross-browser compatibility issues and recognize our members have
			preferred browsers across the spectrum, we cannot promise 100% compatibility at all times with all browsers.
			As such, we can only inform you of compatibility issues as they arise and if/when they'll be addressed.<br /><br />
			For the duration of the beta, we encourage you to use your favorite browser as you normally would and please
			inform us of any issues you encounter with the website either via the uservoice or email links provided above.<br /><br />
			In the meantime, if you would like to view the website as it is intended to look for comparison, the browser
			most compatibile with the site as of 2/14/2014 is <strong>Firefox</strong>.<br /><br />
			We will never require you to change browsers if it is within our power to fix an issue.  However, some things are
			beyond our control and those things will be listed above in our Known Issues section.<br /><br />
			Thanks for your understanding.

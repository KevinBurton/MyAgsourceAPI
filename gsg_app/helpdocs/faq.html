			<li><strong>Q:</strong> When I click on a cow's ID, why doesn't it display?</li>
			<li><strong>A:</strong> There is an issue with older versions of IE that prevent the cow overlay from displaying
			properly.  If you have a recent version of IE, this may also be happening to you if you have "Compatability Mode"
			enabled.  Currently, we are only aware of this affecting IE7 and earlier

			<li><strong>A:</strong> There is an issue currently affecting the latest version of Google Chrome (version 32).
			Google is aware of it and already has a fix in the pipeline.  It should be in the version 34 release of Chrome.</li>
